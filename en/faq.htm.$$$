<p><a name="faq1"></a><b>What is olive oil?</b><br />Olive oil is the juice which we obtain by pressing the olive fruit. It represents the principal fat of the Mediterranean diet and it symbolises a healthy diet.</p> 
<p class="right_brez"><span class="small"> <a href="http://www.vanjadujc.net" onclick="return redirect(' http://www.vanjadujc.net/en/faq.htm#top ');"> Back to the top</a></span></p><br /> 
<p><a name="faq2"></a><b>What are fats and what are oils?</b><br />Fats make up a group of nutrients, which, like proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins and water, are necessary for life and health. Chemically, fats are triglycerids, which means compounds made of glycerol and various types of fatty acids. Fatty acids, bound to glycerol, may be saturated (if they do not posses any double bonds), monounsaturated (they posses one double bond) or polyunsaturated (they posses more double bonds).<br /><br />Triglycerids with a high percentage of saturated fatty acids are solid on the room temperature. They are called greases (the unhealthy fats). On the contrary, oils contain a higher amount of mono and polyunsaturated fatty acids and are liquid on the room temperature. Oils differ among themselves according to which types of fatty acids, linked to glycerol, are present in a specific oil, and in what percentage.</p> 
<p class="right_brez"><span class="small"> <a href="http://www.vanjadujc.net" onclick="return redirect(' http://www.vanjadujc.net/en/faq.htm#top ');"> Back to the top</a></span></p><br /> 
<p><a name="faq3"></a><b>Why is olive oil a special fat?</b><br />Olive oil contains triglycerids (99%) with a high percentage of the very stable oleic acid (monounsaturated). It also contains small amounts (up to 1%) of the so-called non-glycerol substances. It is due to these substances that olive oil has a special position in the protective diet as well as in the gastronomy.<br /><br />The water soluble varieties of the vitamins A, D, E and K and a high amount of phenolic compounds (also called complex phenols) are important components of  olive oil.<br /><br />Phenolic compounds are of an extreme importance because they prevent the oxidation processes to take place within the oil as well as within the human body.</p> 
<p class="right_brez"><span class="small"> <a href="http://www.vanjadujc.net" onclick="return redirect(' http://www.vanjadujc.net/en/faq.htm#top ');"> Back to the top</a></span></p><br /> 
<p><a name="faq4"></a><b>How is olive oil produced?</b><br />Olive fruits are pressed in mills.  The olive juice strains from the olive paste by using different mechanical means. The olive pomace remains as a secundary product. Olive oil is extracted from olive juice with centrifuge. Olive oil, produced from quality fruits, is ready to serve the gastronomic delights immediately after being pressed.</p> 
<p class="right_brez"><span class="small"> <a href="http://www.vanjadujc.net" onclick="return redirect(' http://www.vanjadujc.net/en/faq.htm#top ');"> Back to the top</a></span></p><br /> 
<p><a name="faq5"></a><b>Why the term "oljčno olje" is recently gaining ground at the expense of the term "olivno olje" in Slovene language?</b><br />The history of olive growing in Slovenia is actually the history of olive growing in the Slovene Istra. People living in the Slovene Istra did not use the term "oliva" to refer to the olive, that is, to the fruit. They used expressions "ulje od ulke" (the oil from olive tree) or "domače ulje" (home-grown oil) to refer to olive oil. Thereby, they used the term oljka ( dialectally: ulka) to refer to the tree as well as to its fruit. The term "oliva", meaning the olive, that is, the fruit, originates in Italy.<br /><br />On the suggestion of the scientists that the term "oljka" be used to denominate also the fruit of olive tree, the language arbitration court judged that both terms, "oliva" and "oljka", may be used, meaning the olive tree as well as its fruit, and thereby both the expressions "olivno olje" and "oljčno olje" are correct and signify olive oil.</p> 
<p class="right_brez"><span class="small"> <a href="http://www.vanjadujc.net" onclick="return redirect(' http://www.vanjadujc.net/en/faq.htm#top ');"> Back to the top</a></span></p><br /> 
<p><a name="faq6"></a><b>Is refined olive oil better than virgin olive oil?</b><br />Virgin olive oil not fit for consumption because of bad quality of fruits, improper storage of fruit or because the date of minimum durability has expired, may be "cleaned" by refining methods. This kind of refined oil looses almost all of its biologically important substances which were present in the fruit. Consequently, from the point of view of quality, it cannot be compared with a good extra virgin olive oil.</p> 
<p class="right_brez"><span class="small"> <a href="http://www.vanjadujc.net" onclick="return redirect(' http://www.vanjadujc.net/en/faq.htm#top ');"> Back to the top</a></span></p><br /> 
<p><a name="faq7"></a><b>How are olive oils classified according to the technological procedure and quality?</b><br />Amongst all kinds of edible oils olive oil assumes a special position because of the manner of production and its usage. Due to its high price, frauds, mainly adding chipper oils, are frequent. That is the reason why trade standards applying to olive oils are so strict compared to other oils. Examining the quality of olive oils is a very demanding task.<br /><br />Olive oils are divided in the following categories or subcategories according to the technological procedure and quality parameters:<ol><li>Virgin olive oil</li><ol><li>Extra virgin olive oil: "olive oil of higher category obtained directly from the fruit of the olive tree and solely by mechanical means".</li><li>Virgin olive oil: "olive oil obtained directly from the fruit of the olive tree and solely by mechanical means".</li><li>Lampante virgin olive oil: "olive oil not fit for consumption and needs to be refined".</li></ol><li>Refined olive oil: "olive oil obtained from virgin olive oils by refining methods which do not lead to alteration in the initial glyceridic structure".</li><li>A bland of virgin olive oil and refined olive oil: "olive oil, consisting only of refined olive oil and oil, obtained directly from the fruit of the olive tree".</li><li>Olive-pomace oil: "oil, obtained by treating olive pomace with solvents. According to how it is mixed with refined oils it is divided in a few subcategories."</li></ol></p> 
<p class="right_brez"><span class="small"> <a href="http://www.vanjadujc.net" onclick="return redirect(' http://www.vanjadujc.net/en/faq.htm#top ');"> Back to the top</a></span></p><br /> 
<p><a name="faq8"></a><b>What does "virgin olive oil" mean?</b><br />Virgin olive oil is obtained from the fruit of the olive tree and solely by mechanical means. The olive oil obtained by this manner is virgin because it is neither chemically not thermally treated and does not contain any additives. Virgin olive oils are classified in three categories (extra virgin, virgin and lampante virgin olive oil) on the basis of the sensory and chemical analysis. Extra virgin olive oil is placed in the quality class of the top category.</p> 
<p class="right_brez"><span class="small"> <a href="http://www.vanjadujc.net" onclick="return redirect(' http://www.vanjadujc.net/en/faq.htm#top ');"> Back to the top</a></span></p><br /> 
<p><a name="faq9"></a><b>How is the sensory analysis of virgin olive oil carried out?</b><br />The sensory analysis is carried out according to the prescribed method, stated in the Comitee Directives (EEU n° 2568/91) and in the Comitee Decree (EU no 796/22). The method describes in details the procedure of selecting tasters, the necessary apparatus, the test room and the general basic vocabulary. 8-12 tasters are required for each test. The oil samples shall be kept at 28 °C in standardised dark tasting glasses. The colour of olive oil depends on the variety and on how ripe the fruit was. The olive oil of supreme quality may be yellow as well as green.  Many consumers like the green colour of olive oil, that s why some producers add some leaves to the fruit before pressing, in order that the oil obtains "a nice green colour". But the colour cannot give any assurance of the quality of oil. Nowadays an olive oil with a rich fruity aroma is preferred, that is an olive oil whit a flavour of healthy and fresh, optimally grown olives, apples, fresh almonds, artichokes, tomatoes an of the fresh mown grass. Only an oil, obtained from healthy and completely undamaged fruit, picked in the moment of its optimal ripeness can pride with a rich scale of pleasant aroma. According to his preferences the consumer may choose his favourite oil from a scale of different aromas, characteristic of extra virgin olive oils, that ranges from oils with a gentle fragrance and sweet taste to spicy olive oils. Spicy olive oils are appreciated for their high content of phenolic compounds, which prevent the oxidative processes to take place within our bodies. Unfortunately, many consumers mistake rancidity for spiciness an even for a characteristics of olive oil. An olive oil which prides with a fresh, rich aroma is appreciated mostly for gastronomic purposes. Melting of different aromas which is a consequence of adding olive oil to the dishes produces unbelievable gastronomic delights that are impossible to be achieved with a mild, usually old oil. A sweetish oil is usually produced from over-ripped fruit. In some case it may also be a variety characteristic.</p> 
<p class="right_brez"><span class="small"> <a href="http://www.vanjadujc.net" onclick="return redirect(' http://www.vanjadujc.net/en/faq.htm#top ');"> Back to the top</a></span></p><br /> 
<p><a name="faq10"></a><b>According to what chemical parameters the quality of virgin olive oil is established?</b><br /><ul><li>determination of the free acidity (the content of free fatty acids) – free fatty acids are created during the process of the disintegration of triglycerides;</li><li>determination of the peroxide value – we check whether the oil is oxidised;</li><li>determination of the absorbency in ultra – violet at 232 and 270 nm – we check whether the oil is old or some other kinds of oil, as seed oils, have been mixed to it;</li><li>determination of fatty acid composition – we check the content of a particular type of fatty acid, bound to glycerol.</li></ul>Triglycerids disintegrate to free fatty acids. The damage to fruit cell structures, the over- ripeness of the fruit, the presence of water or the rise of  temperature may influence on how quick the process of disintegration will be. Free acidity is expressed in units, calculated in oleic acid as a common value that joins unsaturated as well as saturated fatty acids. Oil with a higher content of free fatty acids is oil of worse quality.</p> 
<p class="right_brez"><span class="small"> <a href="http://www.vanjadujc.net" onclick="return redirect(' http://www.vanjadujc.net/en/faq.htm#top ');"> Back to the top</a></span></p><br /> 
<p><a name="faq11"></a><b>What influences on the quality of olive oil?</b><br />The olive oil quality is influenced by many parameters, as climatic conditions, soil, geographical position, variety, protection from diseases and pests, the way of treating, fertilising, pruning, picking, processing and the storage. Only from the fruits of high quality a supreme olive oil may be produced. It is impossible to produce olive oil of quality from damaged or wormy fruit.</p> 
<p class="right_brez"><span class="small"> <a href="http://www.vanjadujc.net" onclick="return redirect(' http://www.vanjadujc.net/en/faq.htm#top ');"> Back to the top</a></span></p><br /> 
<p><a name="faq12"></a><b>How much oil can be obtained from olives?</b><br />12-16 litres of olive oil of supreme quality, the amount varies according to the variety, may be obtained from 100 kg of fruit, picked up in the time of it optimal ripeness. On average, 18-22 litres of oil is obtained. Up to 30 litres of low quality olive oil may be produced from olives which were picked late, stored too late before pressed or processed on a too high temperature.</p> 
<p class="right_brez"><span class="small"> <a href="http://www.vanjadujc.net" onclick="return redirect(' http://www.vanjadujc.net/en/faq.htm#top ');"> Back to the top</a></span></p><br /> 
<p><a name="faq13"></a><b>What is the date of durability of olive oil and how it is recommended to be stored?</b><br />Oil may conserve its rich flavour up to 12- 18 months, consequently the date of durability of virgin olive oil is up to 18 months. As a fatty product it can be used for some years; the original structure will not change in the meantime, but the substances as vitamins, phenolic compounds and all structures that add flavour, taste and colour to the oil, will. Oil with an expired date of durability is still suitable for frying, but it cannot adjust to the demanding criteria which determine a supreme olive oil.<br /><br />Oil should be kept in a dark place, at the temperature from 12 to 15°C. Olive oil is very sensitive to oxidation provoked by  UV rays, thus it is better to be kept in dark bottles. To prevent the olive oil from being kept open for to long, it is recommendable buying oil in smaller bottles.</p> 
<p class="right_brez"><span class="small"> <a href="http://www.vanjadujc.net" onclick="return redirect(' http://www.vanjadujc.net/en/faq.htm#top ');"> Back to the top</a></span></p><br /> 
<p><a name="faq14"></a><b>How should a consumer know which oil is a good one?</b><br />Similarly to other food, in which one seeks gastronomic delights, one gains this knowledge with education and by tasting different types of oils. Low price oils cannot be oils of high quality.  In order that an olive oil be considered of a good quality, all the procedures from growing fruit to picking up and processing it should be carried out correctly. The costs of picking fruit by hand, immediate pressing of healthy fruit and monitoring the optimal ripeness are high and, consequently, the price of thus produced oil will rise. It is difficult to conserve a high quality when one deals with huge quantities of olives. In that case, the olives must be picked mechanically, the fruit is carried to mills in trucks, stored in heaps, which all causes mechanical damage, oxidation an enzyme hidrolisis. Oil produced from this kind of fruit is necessarily of a worse quality.</p>

<p><a name="faq15"></a><b>What is cold pressed olive oil?</b><br />The label "cold pressed" may appear only on the extra virgin or virgin olive oil, obtained at a temperature lower than 27°C by straining the oil paste or by a centrifuge. Thus obtained olive oil may conserve all biologically active substances, which increase the durability of olive oil and affect our organism in a benevolent way. If the fruit pressed cold was of a lower quality – if it was too ripe, wormy, mouldy – the olive oil has lost many of the biologically active substances. Consequently, it is not possible to obtain a high quality olive oil from bad quality fruit and the label "cold pressed" cannot ensure that the olive oil is also a quality one.</p>

<p><a name="faq16"></a><b>Is olive oil a safe fat?</b><br />Olive oil is a fat that is absorbed and digested very well; it stimulates the secretion of gastric juice and enables a better absorption of vitamins, particularly of E vitamin. It is successfully used in diabetes diets and in nutrition of babies. Many researches have proofed that olive oil excellently protects against arthritis, coronary heart diseases, breast cancer.<br /><br />Its protective effects are the consequence of the high amount of phenolic compounds, contained in the olive oil, and an equilibrate composition of fatty acids. The energetic value of olive oil is between 3700-3850 kJ/100g. According to dates and recommendations of international organisations which deal with protective nutrition, the proportion of daily intake of fats should not be higher than 30% of individual's daily energetic demand. None the less, the proportion of fatty acids also plays an important role.<br /><br />It is recommended a lower intake of saturated fatty acids possible, a moderate intake of polyunsaturated and a high intake of monounsaturated fatty acids.<br /><br />The protective effect of monounsaturated fatty acid (oleic acid) resides in that it prevents the oxidation of the "bad" LDL cholesterol. Once the LDL cholesterol has oxidised, it accelerates the process of arteriosclerosis.</p>

<p><a name="faq18"></a><b>What does the Mediterranean diet mean and why is it recommended?</b><br />The Mediterranean diet pyramid represents the optimal, traditional Mediterranean diet. It is based on the dietary traditions of Crete and southern Italy in the 1960s. It is structured in the light of nutrition research carried out in 1993 and presented by Professor Walter Willet during the 1993 International Conference on the Diets of the Mediterranean, held in Cambridge, Massachusetts.<br /><br />The Mediterranean Diet Pyramid underlines the importance of the foods making up the principal food groups. Each of these individual food groups offers some, but not all, of the nutrients one needs. Food from one group cannot replace that of another group. All the groups are necessary for a healthy diet.<br /><br />Food groups at the bottom of the pyramid should form the basis of our meals while food groups on its peak are of less importance and should be avoided.<br /><br /><center><img src="../images/faq-piramida.gif" tppabs="http://www.vanjadujc.net/images/faq-piramida.gif" border="0" alt="" /></center><br /><br />Wine can be consumed in moderation, primarily with meals (1-2 glasses/day). It is optional and should be avoided whenever it puts the individuals or others at risk.<br /><br />The proportion of fats in the traditional diet of Crete is &gt;40% kcal/day of which 8% were saturated fats, 3% polyunsaturated and 29% monounsaturated (olive oil).</p>

<p><a name="faq19"></a><b>Does olive oil help to protect from atherosclerosis?</b><br />It has been demonstrated that olive oil has an effect in preventing the formation of blood clots and platelet aggregation. It has been observed that by avoiding excessive blood coagulation, olive-oil-rich diets can attenuate the effect of fatty foods in encouraging blood clot formation, thus contributing to the low incidence of heart failure in countries where olive oil is the principal fat consumed.</p>

<p><a name="faq20"></a><b>Does olive oil reduce the risk of high blood cholesterol?</b><br />Olive oil lowers the levels of total blood cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides. At the same time it does not alter the levels of HDL-cholesterol (and may even raise them), which plays a protective role and prevents the formation of fatty patches, thus stimulating the elimination of the low-density lipoproteins.<br /><br />The beneficial effect of olive oil consumption with regard to cardiovascular disease has been demonstrated in primary prevention, where it reduces the risk of developing the disease, and in secondary prevention, where it prevents recurrence after a first coronary event.<br /><br />At present, research is revealing the effectiveness of the Mediterranean diet in the prevention of secondary coronary events and the positive influence of olive oil on the depression associated with such events and on mood. These findings are very important in view of the high incidence of depression in the modern-day world and the great risk it poses in recurrent heart disease.</p>

<p><a name="faq21"></a><b>Why are antioxidants important and which of them are present in olive oil?</b><br />Oxidation is a process that occurs not only when oil is being produced, but also inside our own bodies. Reactions occur continually inside the body, giving rise to the formation of free radicals (peroxidants). As a rule, free radicals do not cause severe damage thanks to the protection provided by antioxidants, which help to keep a balance up to a point. If the balance is spoiled, however, "oxidative stress" occurs, leading to deterioration of normal cell functions and even cell death.<br /><br />Oxidation is a complex, fundamental phenomenon in the process of cell ageing. Lipid or fat peroxidation tends to be proportional to the number of double bonds in a compound, explaining why oleic acid shows little susceptibility to oxidation.<br /><br />Cell membranes contain a large amount of fat and cholesterol and their composition depends on diet. When the diet contains a lot of olive oil, the cells are more resistant to oxidation, they do not deteriorate as much and ageing is slower.<br /><br />Approximately 1.5% of olive oil is made up of the unsaponifiable fraction, which contains antioxidants. Virgin olive oil contains the largest quantities of these substances and other minor components.<br /><br /> Vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol), carotenoids and phenolic compounds (simple phenols such as hydroxytyrosol and complex phenols such as oleuropein) are all antioxidants whose activity has been demonstrated in vitro and recently in vivo, revealing further advantages in the prevention of certain diseases and also of ageing.<br /><br />The phenolic content of olive oils varies according to the climatic conditions in the producing area, when the olives are harvested and how ripe they are when picked. Oil production and storage methods also have an influence. Phenols have countless biological properties, for instance hydroxytyrosol inhibits platelet aggregation and it is anti-inflammatory and oleuropein encourages the formation of nitric acid, which is a powerful vasodilator and exerts a strong anti-bacterial effect.<br /><br />Oxidised LDLs are known to be atherogenic, which is where olive oil steps in because it has a beneficial, protective effect against LDL oxidation. Moreover, it also strengthens other cells in the body against the toxic effects of oxidants.<br /><br />The explanation behind this high content of antioxidants is probably that because the olive is a fruit that is exposed to the air, it has to defend itself from oxygen. It therefore synthesises a larger amount of antioxidants, which pass through to the oil.<br /><br />Virgin olive oil is particularly rich in these substances and it has a strong antioxidant effect, protecting against damage from free radicals (scavenger activity) and against the formation of cancer.</p>

<p><a name="faq22"></a><b>Does the consumption of olive oil reduce the risk of developing some types of cancer?</b><br />Epidemiological studies suggest that olive oil exerts a protective effect against certain malignant tumours (breast, prostate, endometrium, digestive tract, ...).<br /><br />A number of research studies have documented that olive oil reduces the risk of breast cancer. Eating a healthy diet with olive oil as the main source of fat could considerably lower cancer incidence. The reason is that the cell mutations caused by cancer are partly due to toxins which, when consumed through the diet, attack DNA. On passing through the liver, these toxins produce free radicals that then attack DNA. To combat such free radicals, the body needs vitamins and antioxidants like those contained in olive oil.<br /><br />It has also been reported that an olive-oil-rich diet is associated with reduced risk of bowel cancer. The protective effect of olive oil is irrespective of the amount of fruit and vegetables eaten in the diet.<br /><br />Recent studies have demonstrated that olive oil provides protection against cancer of the colon. Lately, research has been looking into the metabolic implications of fats, more specifically the protective role of olive oil in chronic liver disease and in the disorder of the intestines known as Crohn's disease. Results point to beneficial effects of olive oil on pre-cancerous lesions. After analysing three types of diet, research scientists arrived at various conclusions. The olive oil diet reduced the number of cancerous lesions; the number of tumours that developed was clearly and significantly low; and the tumours were less aggressive and had a better prognosis.<br /><br />This beneficial effect could be related to oleic acid, the predominant monounsaturated fatty acid in olive oil. It has been observed that this fatty acid lowers the production of prostaglandins derived from arachidonic acid, which in turn plays a significant part in the production and development of tumours.<br /><br />However, it is not excluded that other constituents of olive oil, such as antioxidants, flavonoids, polyphenols and squalene may also have a positive influence. Squalene is believed to have a favourable effect on the skin by reducing the incidence of melanomas.<br /><br />Some very promising, current research is centred on the protection provided by olive oil against child leukaemia and various cancers, such as oesophageal squamous cell cancer.<br /><br />Much has still to be discovered about how olive oil affects cancer and concrete data are still lacking on the mechanisms behind the beneficial role it plays in the prevention or inhibition of the growth of different types of cancer. However, according to the information available at present, olive oil could act simultaneously during the different stages involved in the process of cancer formation.</p>

<p><a name="faq23"></a><b>Does the consumption of olive oil help to reduce high levels of the blood pressure?</b><br />It has not yet been clearly established what elements of the Mediterranean diet are responsible for its effects in reducing blood pressure. It has been demonstrated, however, that the addition of olive oil to a diet that is not changed in any other way has a clear lowering effect on blood pressure, which seems to be specific to this oil. Regular consumption of olive oil decreases both systolic (maximum) and diastolic (minimum) blood pressure.<br /><br />There is recent evidence that when olive oil is consumed the daily dose of drugs needed to control blood pressure in hypertensive patients can be decreased, possibly because of a reduction in nitric acid caused by polyphenols.</p>

<p><a name="faq24"></a><b>Is a regular intake of olive oil good for persons with diabetes and high levels of blood sugar?</b><br />An olive-oil-rich diet is not only a good alternative in the treatment of diabetes; it may also help to prevent or delay the onset of the disease. How it does so is by preventing insulin resistance and its possible pernicious implications by raising HDL-cholesterol, lowering triglycerides, and ensuring better blood sugar level control and lower blood pressure. It has been demonstrated that a diet that is rich in olive oil, low in saturated fats, moderately rich in carbohydrates and soluble fibre from fruit, vegetables, pulses and grains is the most effective approach for diabetics. Besides lowering the "bad" low-density lipoproteins, this type of diet improves blood sugar control and enhances insulin sensitivity.<br /><br />These benefits have been documented in child and adult diabetes.</p>

<p><a name="faq25"></a><b>Is olive oil recommended for persons with obesity problems?</b><br />Olive oil is a nutrient of great biological value. Like all other fats and oils it is high in calories (9 Kcal per gram), which could make one think that it would contribute to obesity. However, experience shows that there is less obesity amongst the Mediterranean peoples, who consume the most olive oil.<br /><br />It has been demonstrated that an olive-oil-rich diet leads to greater and longer-lasting weight loss than a low-fat diet. It is accepted better because it tastes good and it is a stimulus to eat vegetables.</p>

<p><a name="faq26"></a><b>How does olive oil influences on our immune system?</b><br />It has been documented that olive oil intake bolsters the immune system against external attacks from microorganisms, bacteria or viruses.<br /><br />It has been known for some time that mineral and vitamin deficiencies can have an adverse effect on the immune system.<br /><br />Recent research has concluded that the fatty acids in the make-up of olive oil are good allies in lowering important immunological parameters such as the proliferation of lymphocytes induced by specific mitogens of both B- and T-cells.<br /><br />These fatty acids have been reported to play an important part in various immune functions. They are involved in regulating inflammatory processes and they may be effective in the treatment of some autoimmune diseases and in the regulation of the immune system in general.</p>

<p><a name="faq27"></a><b>Does olive oil help to reduce the risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis?</b><br />Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory immune disease of unknown causes that affects the joints. Genes, infective factors, hormones and diet have been suggested as possible associates in its onset. Although some studies had suggested that olive oil could help to alleviate its symptoms they did not provide confirmation of such a protective effect.<br /><br />Now, the results of a recently published study suggest that regular consumption of olive oil may reduce the risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis.<br /><br />According to the authors of the study, the people on diets containing high levels of olive oil had less risk of suffering this disease. The study found that the people who consumed less olive oil had 2.5 times more possibility of developing rheumatoid arthritis than those who consumed it more frequently.<br /><br />Although the mechanism involved is not yet clear, antioxidants are suspected to exert a beneficial effect.</p>

<p><a name="faq28"></a><b>Does olive oil have positive effect on our digestive system?</b><br />When olive oil reaches the stomach it does not reduce the tonus of the muscular ring or sphincter at the base of the oesophagus. Because of this, it reduces the risk of the flow or reflux of food and gastric juice up from the stomach to the oesophagus.<br /><br />Olive oil also partially inhibits gastric motility. As a result, the gastric content of the stomach is released more slowly and gradually into the duodenum, giving a greater sensation of "fullness", and favouring the digestion and absorption of nutrients in the intestine.<br /><br />Olive oil and the hepato-biliary system<br />One of the effects of olive oil on the hepato-biliary system is that it is a cholagogue, ensuring optimal bile drainage and full emptying of the gall bladder. Another effect is that it is cholecystokinetic, i.e. it stimulates the contraction of the gall bladder, which is extremely helpful in the treatment and prevention of disorders of the bile ducts. It stimulates the synthesis of bile salts in the liver and it increases the amount of cholesterol excreted by the liver.<br /><br />In short, owing to its beneficial effect on the muscle tone and activity of the gall bladder, olive oil stimulates the digestion of lipids, because they are emulsified by the bile, and it prevents the onset of gallstones.<br /><br />Olive oil and the pancreas<br />When consumed, olive oil produces a small amount of secretion by the pancreas, making this organ "work" little, but efficiently and enough to carry out all its digestive functions. Olive oil is recommended in diseases where pancreatic function has to be maintained, such as pancreas failure, chronic pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis, malabsorption syndromes, etc.<br /><br />Olive oil and the intestines<br />Owing to the sitosterol it contains, olive oil partially prevents cholesterol absorption by the small intestine. It also stimulates the absorption of various nutrients (calcium, iron, magnesium, etc.).<br /><br />Olive oil, therefore, is a fat that is digested and absorbed really well. It has a mild laxative effect that helps to combat constipation and bad breath.</p>

<p><a name="faq29"></a><b>Is olive oil recommended during the pregnancy and the breast feeding?</b><br />Olive oil plays a key role in foetal development during pregnancy and a shortage may have pernicious effects on the baby's subsequent development.<br /><br />It has been demonstrated that the post-natal development of babies of mothers who consumed olive oil when pregnant is better in terms of height, weight, behaviour and psychomotor reflexes.<br /><br />The foetus needs vitamin E to grow. The newborn baby also needs a store of vitamin E to fight against the oxidative stress caused on entering an oxygen atmosphere. Although not very abundant in olive oil, it is present in sufficient quantity thanks to the resistance of olive oil to oxidation.<br /><br />So, both the amount and the type of food consumed in the diet during pregnancy play a key part in the metabolic adaptations that occur in the mother and in her functional relationship with the foetus.<br /><br />During labour, the vitamin E in the mother's blood is concentrated in the breast glands and so, during breast feeding, the mother continues to supply vitamin E. It is essential to maintain the levels of this vitamin during breast feeding.<br /><br />Vitamin E is also recommended for premature and new-born infants with kidney or pancreas failure because of the favourable effect it has on the hepato-biliary system.<br /><br />But olive oil not only provides enough essential fatty acids for the development of the new-born child; its ratio of linoleic acid to linolenic acid (essential fatty acids) is similar to that of breast milk.<br /><br />The beneficial effect of oleic acid lasts beyond pregnancy. Besides its documented effectiveness in preventing hypercholesterolaemia and atherosclerosis, which is a process that can begin in childhood, oleic acid also appears to exert a positive influence on growth and bone mineralisation and development during infancy.</p>

<p><a name="faq30"></a><b>Does olive oil help to prevent from the problems related to ageing?</b><br />Olive oil is rich in various antioxidants (vitamin E, polyphenols, ...) which play a positive, biological role in eliminating free radicals, the molecules involved in some chronic diseases and ageing, and in extending life expectancy, which has been demonstrated in several epidemiological studies.<br /><br />Many ageing-related diseases are influenced by diet, in particular osteoporosis and deteriorated cognitive function.</p>

<p><a name="faq31"></a><b>How does olive oil influence on the development of the osteoporosis?</b><br />Olive oil appears to have a favourable effect on bone calcification, and bone mineralisation is better the more olive oil is consumed.

<p><a name="faq32"></a><b>Does a regular intake of olive oil help to reduce the risk of deterioration of cognitive function?</b><br />Olive-oil-rich diets may prevent memory loss in healthy elderly people. Less possibility of suffering age-related cognitive decline has been observed in a study conducted on elderly people administered diets containing a large amount of monounsaturated fats, the case of olive oil particularly.<br /><br />Exactly how large quantities of these fats prevent cognitive decline is not known. However, this effect is believed to occur because the monounsaturated fatty acids may help to maintain the structure of the brain cell membranes since the demand for these acids appears to grow during ageing.<br /><br />The same study observed that the quantity of olive oil consumed was inversely proportional to age-related cognitive decline and memory loss, dementia and Alzheimer's disease.</p>

<p><a name="faq33"></a><b>Does olive oil have some positive effects on our skin?</b><br />In human beings ageing leads to gradual structural and functional skin damage.<br /><br />Skin tissue goes through a number of changes. Some of the chief ones are that the inner and outer layers of the skin (dermis and epidermis) grow thinner, elasticity is lost, the area joining the dermis to the epidermis becomes less cushioned, fibrosis occurs with the accumulation of collagen and the tissue is less able to fight against and repair damage.<br /><br />External factors, such as the sun's rays, speed up ageing by generating free radicals. Though cells are equipped with mechanisms that neutralise their action, it is possible to reduce cell damage by using inhibitors that lower the risk. One such natural inhibitor is olive oil, whose lipid profile is very similar to that of human skin.<br /><br />On top of polyphenols, olive oil has a large proportion of vitamins A, D and K, as well as vitamin E, the main source of protection against the free radicals that produce cell oxidation. This makes it a good aid in specific therapies to treat skin disorders such as acne, psoriasis and seborrheic eczemas.<br /><br />It has also been suggested that because of its pronounced antioxidant effect, olive oil could play a choice part in the prevention of continuous oxidation, one of the processes that influences the development of certain types of skin cancer. Vitamin E studies have begun, but these kinds of observations take a long time, which means that conclusive data are not yet available. However, the theory is that oleic acid is believed to play a major part in counteracting continuous oxidation.</p>
